# Concret-Strength
Description Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size, as opposed to tensile strength, which withstands loads tending to elongate.  compressive strength is one of the most important engineering properties of concrete. It is a standard industrial practice that the concrete is classified based on grades. This grade is nothing but the Compressive Strength of the concrete cube or cylinder. Cube or Cylinder samples are usually tested under a compression testing machine to obtain the compressive strength of concrete. The test requisites differ country to country based on the design code.  The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients .These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.  Attribute information Cement (component 1) — quantitative — kg in a m3 mixture — Input Variable Blast Furnace Slag (component 2) — quantitative — kg in a m3 mixture — Input Variable Fly Ash (component 3) — quantitative — kg in a m3 mixture — Input Variable Water (component 4) — quantitative — kg in a m3 mixture — Input Variable Superplasticizer (component 5) — quantitative — kg in a m3 mixture — Input Variable Coarse Aggregate (component 6) — quantitative — kg in a m3 mixture — Input Variable Fine Aggregate (component 7) — quantitative — kg in a m3 mixture — Input Variable Age — quantitative — Day (1~365) — Input Variable Concrete compressive strength — quantitative — MPa(megapascals) — Output Variable
